# Book Recommendation System

**Live Demo:** [View the demo here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rathormanoj08/book_recommender)

This repository contains a Book Recommendation System that uses fine-tuned Sentence-BERT (SBERT) embeddings to recommend books based on the similarity of their summaries and shared categories.

## Features
 - **`Preprocessing`**: Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and organizes categories for each book.
 - **`Embedding Generation`**: Fine-tunes Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) on book summaries for domain-specific embeddings.
 - **`Efficient Search`**: Utilizes Faiss for fast searches.
 - **`Similarity Scoring`**: Combines cosine similarity and category filtering to ensure highly relevant recommendations.
 - **`Scalable Design`**: Modularized code for data preprocessing, embedding generation, and recommendation.

## File Structure
 - **`app.py`**: The main script for running the recommendation system.
 - **`books_summary.csv`**: The dataset containing book summaries, categories, and names.
 - **`preprocessed_books_data.csv`**: Processed dataset after cleaning and feature engineering.
 - **`book_embeddings.npy`**: Precomputed embeddings of book summaries (after fine-tuning SBERT).
 - **`faiss_index.bin`**: Faiss index for efficient similarity search.
 - **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## How It Works
 - **`Preprocessing`**:
    - Handles missing or empty rows for book_name and summaries.
    - Removes duplicates and groups categories for each book.
    - Splits categories into lists for efficient category filtering.

 - **`Fine-Tuning`**:
    - Fine-tunes Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) using stratified book pairs created based on:
    - Semantic similarity: Calculated using SBERT.
    - Jaccard similarity: Based on category overlap.

 - **`Embedding Generation`**:
    - Generates embeddings using the fine-tuned model and saves them as book_embeddings.npy.

 - **`Faiss Indexing`**:
    - Builds a Faiss L2 Index for fast nearest-neighbor searches.
    - Saves the index as faiss_index.bin.

 - **`Recommendation`**:
     - Searches for similar books using Faiss.
     - Filters recommendations based on shared categories with the input book.
     - Returns the top 5 recommendations ranked by similarity.
